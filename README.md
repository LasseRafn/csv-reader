# Just a reader wrapper around league/csv to skip all the annoying bits.

No documentation will be supplied, because its just used for some of my own stuff, and honestly you should just use league/csv. 

I got tired of the ever-changing API and generally the entire API. This is just a slimmed down wrapper that fits most of my usage.
